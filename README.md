# Gaza Students Beyond Borders

This repository contains the source code for the official website of **Gaza Students Beyond Borders**, a non-profit initiative based in Italy.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to support students from Gaza in continuing their education by providing scholarships, safe housing, and pathways to study at universities abroad. We believe in the power of education to rebuild futures and create lasting change.

## About the Website

*   **Our Projects:** Details on our student support and educational programs.
*   **How to Donate:** Secure options to contribute financially to our cause.
*   **Baladi Market:** An online shop where proceeds support our students.
*   **Volunteer Opportunities:** Information on how to get involved and offer support.
